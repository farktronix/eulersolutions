/*
 The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 
 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 
 (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025  385 = 2640.
 
 Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
